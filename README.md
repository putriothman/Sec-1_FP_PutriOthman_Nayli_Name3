# Stat 184 Final Project--Fall 2024

This repo will serve as the template file for the course project. Further, this README file contains the project guidelines as a checklist, key dates to be aware of, the list of learning outcomes being assessed with this project, and a few suggestions. Be sure to read through all portions of the README carefully.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide you with an opportunity to put into practice *everything* that you have learned over the course of the semester and to push yourselves. To this end, you'll work in teams to conduct your own Exploratory Data Analysis, posing and answering your own research question(s). The [Example Report](https://github.com/Stat184-Fall2024/Course_Project_Guidelines/blob/main/ExampleReport.pdf) found in this repo will provide you with a target to aim for. Please note that this example is purposefully written to reflect the Adept level and contains extra features.

## Project Guidelines 

We present the guidelines as a checklist in this README. This means that your team can edit the copy of this README in your repo by placing an x inside of the square brackets at the start of each item (i.e., [x]). This will help your team keep track of what you've completed and what you have left to do.

- [ ] Read through README
- [ ] Find 1 or 2 other individuals who you want to work with and form a team. (NOTE: unless you have specifically been given permission to do so, __you may not work alone__.)
- [ ] Create a repo using this template repo. Name your repo `Sec#_FP_Name1_Name2_Name3` where `Sec#` is your section of Stat184 (i.e., `Sec1`, `Sec2`, `Sec3`, or `Sec4`) and `Name#` is replaced with the names of each team member.
  - [ ] The owner of the repo should be `Stat184-Fall2024`. 
- [ ] Make sure that each team member has access to the repo.
- [ ] Come up with a topic and set of research questions your team will explore.
- [ ] Make a plan for your work. We suggested putting together your work plan by <mark>Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024</mark>.
- [ ] Locate appropriate data sources for your project.
  - [ ] Your main data source may __not__ be one that we used in class nor be found in any R package.
  - [ ] Supplementary data sources may come from anywhere.
- [ ] Read in your data and perform any necessary data wrangling and cleaning.
- [ ] Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis.
- [ ] Prepare a reproducible report.
  - [ ] Use a QMD file; the output type is PDF.
  - [ ] The report should be well organized with section headings
  - [ ] Code should __only__ be found in a Code Appendix at the end for a PDF, not in the body of your report.
    - __TIP!__ The following code chunk can be added to a QMD file and will automatically build a section of code.
````
      ```{r codeAppend, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
      ```
````
  - [ ] State your research questions and explain them.
  - [ ] Describe the provenance of your data. That is, where did you get the data, who collected the data, for what purpose, who/what make up the cases.
  - [ ] Explain how your data meet the FAIR and/or CARE Principles.
  - [ ] Describe what attributes you'll focus your analysis on (mention if they are part of your data sets or if you created them out of your data sets).
  - [ ] Create multiple data visualizations (tables and figures) that assist both the team and readers in understanding the data.
    - [ ] Data visualizations should show a variety of your skills and geometries.
    - [ ] __Optional__: If your research question/data make sense to do so, try creating a map.
    - [ ] Data visualizations should be appropriately sized--not too small and not too big.
    - [ ] Figures and Tables should have appropriate captions and appropriately cross-referenced in the body of your report.
    - [ ] Your team must produce at least one table that is *not* a display of raw data.
    - [ ] Your team must produce at least one plot/graph.
    - [ ] There should be narrative text helping readers to better understand what the visualization helps them to learn about the data and context.
  - [ ] Your report should narrative text (beyond explaining tables and figures) that explains the context and helps the reader make sense of what is going on.
  - [ ] __Optional:__ For those who want to challenge themselves further, feel free to include a section on using other statistical methods such as hypothesis testing, regression, ANOVA, or machine learning--see Chapter 18 of the Data Computing eBook.
  - [ ]  You should properly cite any work you reference (including data) according to your choice of citation style. We've included files for APA7 and MLA9 as part of this template. If you want to use a different citation style, you will need download the CSL file from the [Zotero Style Respository](https://www.zotero.org/styles/) and include it in your team's repo.
    - __Fail Safe:__ You can also put your citations as footnotes. 
- [ ] Use GitHub to share changes and edits; there should be multiple commits to your repo.
  - [ ] Each team member must have at least two (2) commits in the repo's history.
  - [ ] There should be at must be at least one Pull Request that resulted in a successful merging of two branches.
  - [ ] One team member should create the Pull Request while a *different* team member should review and complete the Pull Request.
  - [ ] Ensure that your instructor has access to your repo.
  - [ ] __Optional:__ Use the repo's Issues system to track and address any problems, core tasks, etc. 
- [ ] All code should be written according to a Style Guide of your choice. List this Style Guide as a code comment in your first code chunk.
  - __Possible Style Guides:__ There are several different coding Style Guides you can follow; here are a few. [The BOAST Style Guide](https://educationshinyappteam.github.io/Style_Guide/coding.html), [The Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
- [ ] Sign up for your Work-in-Progress Presentation
- [ ] Complete your Work-in-Progress Presentation (details below)
- [ ] Finalize your work and submit your report as a __PDF__ to the appropriate submission portal in Canvas by the deadline.
  - [ ] As a comment on your submission, include a link to your team's project repo.
- [ ] Each team member must complete their own copy of the Self & Peer Evaluations QMD file and upload the rendered file (HTML, PDF, or Word) to the appropriate submission portal in Canvas by the deadline.

## Work-in-Progress Presentations

In the last week of classes (Dec. 11th and 13th), each group will give a short presentation to the class (<mark>approximately 3-5 minutes</mark>). In the presentation, each team will share what they are exploring, share __one (1)__ insight they have had, and __one (1)__ challenge they have encountered as they work (if any). As the name suggests, these presentations are not for teams to present polished and completed reports but instead to give a snapshot of what they are currently doing to help inspire other teams.

## FAQs
+ __I want to work alone. Can I do this project by myself?__
  + No. Statistics and Data Science are deeply collaborative fields and you need to learn how to work effectively in a team setting. As such this project was designed with collaboration and team work as a core component. 
+ __Can we use a past project from another course for this project?__
  + No. Submitted work that you already received a grade in another course is a violation of Academic Integrity.
+ __Can we use a project from another (current) course for this project?__
  + No. There is not enough time for the faculty to meet and negotiate how one project will fully satisify the requirements for the separate courses.
+ __One of the team members works in a research lab. Can we use data from that lab for our project?__
  + YES! Provided you have permission from the lab's Principle Investigator (PI).
+ __Can we use the data from another course's project?__
  + Tentatively, yes. Your team will need to disclose this as part of your data provenance and check with your instructor early on in the process. While you may use the data, you *may not* use the same analysis as what was used in the other course's project. Be prepared to show the other course's project upon instructor request.   
+ __What does a good example of the Final Project look like?__
  - Check out the various projects listed at the end of the Data Computing eBook as well as the example report. Those as well as the activities, especially towards the later parts of the course can help give you a sense of the scope for this project.
+ __Can I use Python (or another language)?__
  - STAT 184 is an R programming course, and the project is intended to evaluate learning objectives of this course so you should mostly be using R and your entire analysis must be self-contained in a single QMD.  However, if you want to do something in the project that we have not learned about in class (using R) and prefer to use Python or some other language for that purpose it's fine to include some Python chunks in your QMD file.
+ __Where can we get ideas for good data sources?__
  - https://www.data.gov/ --home of US government open data initiative.  Similarly, many states & communities have their own open data websites as well if you search the Internet.
  - https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data --FiveThirtyEight (https://fivethirtyeight.com/) is a media outlet known for doing some excellent data analysis in many of their articles and stories.  Much of their data is shared in a GitHub Repo.
  - https://github.com/nytimes --New York Times GitHub Repo with supporting data from many stories they have published.
  - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday --Your primary data set must NOT come from an R package.  You can usually download a CSV of the data hosted by Tidy Tuesday (if needed for your primary--they give you the `read_csv` code) or you can use their R package directly for a secondary source.
  - https://scorenetwork.org/ --The SCORE Network is a national network for developing and disseminating projects and data at the intersection of Sports and Data Science.
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets --Kaggle has a variety of data sets available for use. __Caution:__ not all of the data sets on Kaggle are *real* data but rather manufactured data. Do your due diligence.
  - Your instructor also has some data files you might be able to use.
  - Keep in mind that if any team submits a project that looks too similar to work done by someone else it would be an academic integrity violation.  
+ __We're really stuck on what to do. Help?__
  - What shared interests does your team have? Do you all like a particular sport? Do you like a particular type of music? Do you like to play video games?
  - Come talk to your instructor. We can help you come up with an idea.
